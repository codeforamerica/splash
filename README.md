# Splash

A repo for static splash pages for Code for America projects (in particular, for Google AdWords ads)

## Why?

CfA has plenty of AdWords credits that can be used for outreach to potential users, but AdWords links must be on codeforamerica.org.

This repo lets you meet this requirement by having your own standalone page on [http://splash.codeforamerica.org](http://splash.codeforamerica.org).

## How to set up a page

1. Create a new folder for your project (eg, /PROJECTNAME)

2. Add an "index.html" file with your AdWords splash page

3. Configure your AdWords ad to point to http://splash.codeforamerica.org/PROJECTNAME/LANGUAGE/
